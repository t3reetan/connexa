## Getting Started

Disclaimer: Please only use `yarn` as we don't want any conflicts of npm & yarn during the development process!

First, install the required package dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the webpage.

## More info

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploying on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

It connects to your Github repo directly and provides a seamless CI/CD + deployment experience.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
